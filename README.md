## [PureMVC](http://puremvc.github.com/) [Dart](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-dart-multicore-framework/wiki) Demo - Reverse Text
This simple demo shows the most common actors and collaborations found in a PureMVC application. A form allows you to enter text, click a button and have the text reversed and displayed in another text box. A check box allows you to have your text reversed continuously as you type. Finally, when the text in the input box is the same as the text after reversal, the output text box's label changes to indicate that a palindrome was detected.

## Status
Production - [Version 2.0.4](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-dart-demo-reversetext/blob/master/VERSION)

## Platforms / Technologies
* [Google Dart](http://www.dartlang.org)
* JavaScript, DOM
* [Bootstrap Base CSS](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html)

## Features
Keep in mind that this demo is not about achieving the smallest amount of code, but rather to demonstrate the classes, responsibilities, and collaboration patterns that are typically used in a PureMVC-based application of any size.

Demonstrated are how to...
* Use a Facade instance to initialize and startup a PureMVC core.
Prepare the Model, View, and Controller regions of the PureMVC core using a MacroCommand and SimpleCommands.
* Use a Mediator to forward user input from view components on to other parts of a PureMVC core for processing.
* Use business logic in a SimpleCommand that both updates data in a Proxy and conditionally notifies an Mediator with information about the process.
Store data in an Proxy, and have the Proxy notify the rest of the core when that data is changed.
Have an Mediator show interest in certain Notifications and handle them by updating its view component.
* Internet Explorer is not supported by this demo. In order to bring you a demo that shows only PureMVC and the DOM with no other interference or abstractions, we decided to support only on W3C compliant browsers.
Twitter's Bootstrap is used only for its Base CSS, to make it look pretty.
